# Figma Colour Palette Plugin
A colour palette plugin for Figma that helps you create colour scales and save them to your local variables. This plugin was built by me for the design team at an agency.

## What can you do with this plugin?
- Automatically generate colour tints from a base colour that you select. The plugin will create a colour scale with tints from 100-900 for use in your projects.
- Save colour variables into Figma's local variables.
- Rename colour variables.

## How to get started?
- Install the plugin from Figma to use it in your project.
- Set up a collection called 'Colours : Primitives'. The plugin uses this collection to create and edit colour scales and will not work without it!
