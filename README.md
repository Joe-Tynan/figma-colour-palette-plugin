# Figma Colour Palette Plugin
A colour palette plugin for Figma that helps you create colour scales and save them to your local variables.

## How to get started?

- Set up a collection called 'Colours : Primitives'. The plugin uses this collection to create and edit colour scales and will not work without it!
